<p>
The aim of this page is to provide visual and optical illusions
 which I think are not the sort that are seen in 101 books etc on 
illusions. They fall in four categories, which are, in order of 
preference: </p>
<ul>
<li>New illusions: good illusions which explore a new or unusual psychological effect. </li>
<li>Hard to explain illusions: illusions where I find it difficult to understand how they work. </li>
<li>Novel presentations: old illusions presented in a novel and artistic way which somehow heightens the effects of the illusion. </li>
<li>New explorations: old (or new) illusions set in a way that enables a better explanation of the illusory effect. </li>
</ul>
<p>The right to copy or distribute any of the illusions on this site is 
at the sole discretion of the relevant copyright owner. However I would 
appreciate a reference to this site if you did discover an illusion from
 this page, and do borrow it for your own purposes. Necessarily a page 
of unusual illusions is a self-defeating ambition for a popular site, so
 all acknowledgements of this page are gratefully received! Please do 
not embed any images on this server in your own pages. It will not work 
anyway - all the images regularly change names. By all means use links 
to the image page or visual illusion page, or obtain permission to copy 
the item to your own server.

<p>Okay. I admit. It is years since I added to this page, but I bumped 
into these doing the rounds (I have tried to find out, but don't know 
the rights holder for these - if you know who I should attribute these 
to/request permission from, then do let me know). It is a golden oldie 
illusion, but done very well. I have to thank my son for drawing my 
attention to them.

<h3>Previous illusions of the month</h3>
<p>This month is another old favourite type of illusion. A great use of YouTube: Its... the... 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voAntzB7EwE">Colour Changing Card Trick</a>.

Unfortunately not everyone will see the following illusions, as not 
everyone is red/blue depth illusion sensitive. Furthermore for those who
 are, the majority will see the red in front of the blue, but a few will
 see it the other way round. Depth illusions like this are very 
peculiar. Despite the fact that the surface is entirely flat, we 
perceive a stereo visual affect. Furthermore if you shut one eye the 
effect goes away! This is despite the fact that your stereo vision 
should actually be giving you information counter to your perception.
</p>
<p>
This month we publicise the work of <a href="http://www.elinbjorsvik.com/gallery.htm">Elin Bjorsvik</a>,
 which I first saw in an exhibition at the C venue of the Edinburgh 
Fringe Festival. Most of this work is acrylic on canvas. Needless to say
 the image renditions here fail to do justice to the original works, but
 they do get a feel across. Here I focus on those of her works that are 
red/blue illusions, but there are many more to see on the website.

<p>This months illusion was brought to my attention by <a href="http://illusionsetc.blogspot.com/">Walt Anthony</a>,
 and the example given here is his. It is an interesting and 
enlightening illustration of the colour aftereffect illusion. Stare at 
the nose in the negative image below for at leat 1 minute, preferably 
longer. Then move your cursor over the image, and it will change. Keep 
staring at the same spot. I don't really need to say anything else 
really.</p>

 is about time I split this page up as it really is getting a bit long. 
However I am afraid I don't have time for that just at the moment, so 
sorry if the page takes a little long to load.  Let's get on with the 
business: this month is fun. I liked this too much not to include it. <a href="http://www.andrewlipson.com/">Andrew Lipson</a>
 has a great site, including a fun front page. Of particular relevance 
to us though, is a bit of work he has been doing in everyone's favourite
 building material. There is a lot more to be seen but I'd just like to 
show one piece here. It is Andrew's version of Escher's "Ascending and 
Descending". Click for a larger version. This was joint work with Daniel
 Shiu. The full details regarding the construction can be found at <a href="http://www.andrewlipson.com/escher/ascending.html">Andrew's Lego Escher</a>

<p>It is about time I explained the little quicklink to this page in the
 menu to the left. Recently I received an email circular which caught my
 attention. Many of you will also have seen it. It read </p>
<p><b>
Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at Havrard uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht
 oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the 
frist and lsat ltteer is in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl 
mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do 
not raed ervey lteter by itslef but the wrod as a wlohe. Initsereg!!
</b></p>
<p>
I thought this was a fun email as it attempted to prove its point by the
 very process of reading it! I found that, so long as I did not 
concentrate on the words, I could read the sentence as fast as I could 
have read it without the letters being jumbled up. Of course there are 
many cues, and one could argue that some cheating has been going on. For
 example maintaining the phonetic end of words ('ng' 'ch', and 'st') 
does help, but it is not necessary. I tried with a host of different 
sentences, trying hard to mess things up, and in general things were 
readable. Longer words naturally became harder to decipher and 
understandably context was quite helpful. It is certainly not as simple 
as the email makes out, but it is a good first approximation.
</p>
<p>
I also did a little research on the history of the email, and found 
something quite interesting. When the email first started out, it began 
with the words 'According to research at Cambridge University', with the
 letters suitably jumbled. At some point in its history, this was 
changed. A classic example of Scientific Imperialism :).
</p>
<p>
Those interested in following up this effect might be interested in 
looking at research into the way the two hemispheres process word data, 
and work on eye movements during reading. Often the eye focusses centre 
word, and each half of the word is processed by different halves of the 
brain, with the information from each part eventually being combined. 
However eye movements are a little more complicated than this when 
reading sentences...
</p> 
<p>
The final part of the quicklink is the repeated 'the' illusion which is 
very well known, usually in the context of 'Paris in the the Spring'.
</p>

<p>
The following demonstration, by Daniel White, is a great use of the 
colour aftereffect illusion. The image below (click for a larger, more 
effective version) will give an example of a colour you will never see 
on your computer screen. Stare at the dot in the centre of the red 
circle for three to five minutes. You will see the edges of the circle 
begin to glow, but do not stop staring at that point - keep on. After a 
few minutes move your head back and you will see a glowing ring around 
the red circle. The colour you are seeing is a cyan which will be 
perceptually totally different from any of the colours you have seen on 
your computer. The colour gradient to the right shows the shades of 
'cyan' which your computer can produce, none of which match the colour 
you see with this effect.
</p>
<center><a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/funpics/cyanshow.png"><img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/cyanshowsm.png" alt="True cyan demo" border="0"></a><br>&nbsp;<br>(c) Daniel White, included with permission.</center>
<p>
There are two contributions to this illusion. First note that the colour
 aftereffect perceptually subtracts the red you have been staring at 
from the colour (computer cyan) you are now looking at. The basic point 
is that computer cyan is very distinct from true cyan. The first reason 
for this is that both CRT and LCD monitors produce colour bleed. This 
means there is a significant amount of red in the cyan produced by the 
computer monitor. To see this fill the screen with cyan (or better still
 put a cyan line on the screen) in a dark room, and use a CD surface to 
produce a diffraction pattern from the light. You will see a red line 
which is produced by the diffraction pattern. This is the red coming 
from the screen.
</p>
<p>
The other effect is more subtle, and is to do with the limitations of 
tricolour coding. The eye has 3 cones which detect colour. However the 
response curves for the three cones overlap significantly. This is what 
allows the eye to distinguish a variety of colours. True cyan does in 
fact produce a significant response in the eye's 'red' cone (say about 
10% of maximum absorbtion). However by mixing green and blue it is not 
possible to produce even that little 'red' response due to the 
nonlinearities of the response curves. For green-blue cyan the red cone 
is at about 20-25% of maximum absorbtion (the numbers are guessed from 
the graph, so don't quote me on it). Hence the colour we perceive is 
equivalent to a true cyan plus a bit of red. In fact true cyan is one of
 the hardest colours to represent in tricolour coding. For more 
information see
this <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/294215.html">lecture on colour image processing</a>,
 especially figure 3, the C.I.E Chromaticity Diagram. It is clear from 
this figure that cyan lies on the 'edge' of the CIE region which has the
 highest curvature. The colours representable with a tricolour coding 
scheme are those which lie in the interior of the triangle with vertices
 at the three colours. The curvature of edge of the CIE region means it 
is a hard to pick values for R, G and B to contain cyan in the RGB 
triangle. It also shows the the computer is necessarily fundamentally 
anaemic at producing the true variety of greens the eye can detect.

<p>The work of <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi Kitaoka</a>
 provides some exemplary illustrations of visual illusions. He goes to 
some lengths to attempt to create as heightened an illusory effect as 
his can. There are many anomalous motion illusions about, but I believe 
that some of the ones Akiyoshi has generated are some of the most 
effective I have seen. Here is my current favourite. Click to get a 
larger, more overwhelming version.

<p>
There have been a number of analyses of the motion illusion. The most 
obvious interpretation would seem to be in terms of what computer vision
 scientists call optic flow. The paper <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/272851.html">The Ouchi Illusion as an Artifact of Biased Flow Estimation</a> takes that line of analysis. 
</p>
<p>By the way I have also added an addition to an earlier Kitaoka 
illusion on this page - the bulge illusion now accompanies the curved 
checkerboard.

<img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/bellotcube2red.jpg" alt="ghostly cube of Bellot" hspace="20" align="left">
 This month's illusion is an interesting composition along an old 
favourite theme. The fact that it takes things into three dimensions, 
and produces the ghostly cube effect using only shading changes which do
 do not disrupt the underlying structure of the blocks in the 
composition are what I think gives it the edge. This work is copyright 
of Michel Bellot and is included with his permission. A larger copy of 
the illusion can be found at <a href="http://figuresfictives.free.fr/Dessins/JeuxDessin/fictive_3c.html">Illusion: Cube 2</a>, and more of Michel Bellot's work can be found at <a href="http://figuresfictives.free.fr/">FIgURES FiCTiVeS</a>.

<p>I am afraid I haven't been able to come up with that good an illusion this month. However this occasionally fools a few people.
</p>
<img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/cubicsm.jpg" alt="cube in two pieces" hspace="20" align="left"><p>A
 craftsman took two solid pieces of wood, and carved them so they could 
be put together in the form illustated below (the slight overhang is 
only used to illustrate the two parts). Each part is solid, and cannot 
be seperated. The whole block is solid and has no spaces inside. The 
full cube could be lifted by picking up the top half. 
</p>
<p>How was this cube created (no adhesive used)?

      "significant gains" in your stock market
      investments (yeah, right, sure). The associated image
      seemed to promise an infinite supply of money!
      It is effectively a (less aesthetic) version of 
                     the Escher "ever

<p>I was trying to get a copy of the optical pool illusion from the Plum
 Temple in Zhaoqing for this months illusion. Unfortunately I failed. 
However I did come across one of Jerry Andrus' many inventions which I 
thought should feature here as a 'real' version of an earlier illusion.
</p>
<p>The left image is the illusion, the right is how he did it. 
Interestingly the same effect is achieved by a different means than the 
rotating version I put here earlier.

Look at the centre of the three yellow dots and take in the motion of 
the blue ones. Eventually the yellow dots will disappear for a short 
while. If the rotation is going too slowly, clicking on the image might 
help.

<p>This is a motion induced blindness illusion, from Bonneh, Cooperman and Sagi's nature paper (411:798-801).

<p><img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/cuberotate.gif" alt="rotating cube" width="107" height="80" align="left">This
 month we have more of the same. The link on last month's optical 
illusion showed how even the temporal cues of rotation could not 
overcome the convexity assumptions for a face. This month shows how 
temporal cues are generally pretty poor anyway. Here a real object is 
rotated into an illusory position, and yet still the brain will not keep
 track of the real object and sees the peculiar illusory object. For a 
larger (approx 1MB) avi of this click <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/funpics/cuberotate.avi">here</a>. This illusion was found on <a href="http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~natis/amazing/">Natis' site.</a>
</p>
<p>
Oh and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/craterorhill.html">here</a> is a real example of last months illusion, also taken from the same site.
</p>

<p><img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/shading.png" alt="convex or concave" width="142" hspace="20" height="85" align="right">
So this image consists of 5 circular bumps pointing out and one circular
 depression, right? But if you work it out the shading of the bumps 
could equally imply the opposite: 5 concave bumps and one convex one. 
The brain assumes that light comes from above. In Bayesian speak, the 
prior distribution on light source position is used to infer the 
convexity. Flip the image the other way up, and the bumps invert. There 
is now one convex bump.<img src="Amos%20Storkey%20-%20Visual%20Illusions_files/shadinginv.png" alt="convex or concave" width="142" hspace="20" height="85" align="right">
</p>
<p>So what happens if the image is rotated through 90 degrees. Here is 
an animated example.
How this is seen varies across people: for some the perception flips 
back and forth, where convexity is assumed for the largest number. For 
others they stick with one perception, with only a single bump flipping 
at each time. Others see it all as convex objects with peculiar things 
happening to the lighting locally. One common experience is to view 
whatever button you are focussed on as convex and others in relation to 
that shading. Interestingly in this situation, when that button flips, 
it is viewed as all the rest of the buttons flipping instead. In 
general, though, the brain seems to have a higher prior probability for 
convex objects than for concave ones (in Bayes speak). Most people can 
get a number of these perceptions by varying where they are looking. </p>

</center>
<br clear="right"> &nbsp;
<p>The most impressive example of the brain's convexity preference comes
 from the classic inverted mask illusion. A good example of this can be 
seen at <a href="http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/fcs_hollow-face/index.html">this site</a>  (requires fair bandwidth and a quicktime plugin). </p>

This month we try a line-based illusion. These might seem less 
impressive, but this is probably simply because we've seen them many 
times before. Even so I think these two illustrations show off the 
effect to a degree beyond what we are used to. Of course you don't need 
me to tell you that the lines are straight. These illusions are two of 
the many great works of <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi Kitaoka</a>, and he holds the copyright. Included with permission.

See the following image? Look at regions 1 and 2.
The two diamonds are of equal brightness. (Thanks to David Mackay for 
bringing this illusion to my attention - I think it is one of the best).
 If you are not convinced then try printing the image out, cutting out 
one diamond and overlaying it on the other. The more digitally minded 
could just test the pixel values in the image. This is the Logvinenko 
illusion, and is the strongest lightness illusion in its class. For an
